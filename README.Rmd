## Overview

Sediment Deposition and Accumulation Rates Determined by 210Pb Isotope Methods.

## Installation

The ‘leadR’ package is not available on the official CRAN servers.

However, the latest development builds can directly be installed from GitHub. Simply run the following from an R console

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tzerk/leadR")
```

## Features

Example of the 'Constant Flux Constant Sedimentation Rate' (CF:CS) model ouput:

```{r model}
# Load example data (synthetic)
data(Pb)
str(Pb)

# Apply the model
results <- calc_SedimentationRate(x = Pb,
                                  reverse = TRUE,
                                  fix_a0 = FALSE,
                                  verbose = TRUE)
```
